### Product Description 

This multi-level cat furniture will keep your indoor cat happy, healthy and entertained for hours. The BestPet 54in Cat Tree Tower for Indoor Cats provides a multitude of playful and comfortable places to rest or play. Each level offers multiple perches and a plushy condo where your kitty can curl up and sleep. There is also a sturdy sisal pole that they can scratch on if they desire. The BestPet Cat Tree is made from high-quality materials with skin-friendly faux fur all over.

### Our Rating For This Product

I really enjoy this cat tree tower. It's well made, and it's sturdy enough to handle my two playful cats. The fabric is really soft and high quality. I was worried the kittens would make a mess of it, but they haven't yet! The scratching post is thick and sisal in an excellent location, giving them an option to scratch when they want. I like the interaction the cat tree tower has with the rest of my living room décor. One thing I've noticed is that if you have long hair, watch out for getting it caught on the plushy material on the lounging/sleeping areas.

### Customers Say about this product

> My kittens love to play with it when I put them on top but they still prefer regular boxes lol. All of the piece came in and arrived earlier than expected :)

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 It's well made and sturdy enough to handle two playful cats.|👉  Not all cats will use it: If you have more than one cat, there's no guarantee they'll both take to the cat tree tower.|
| 👉 The fabric is really soft and high quality. |👉  It can be unstable: The cat tree tower is top-heavy, so if your cats are climbing on it a lot or playing too roughly, it can tip over. This has happened to me twice already!
|
| 👉 The scratching post is thick and sisal in an excellent location, giving them an option to scratch when they want|👉  It sheds: Like all plushy fabrics, the fabric on the cat tree tower will shed over time as your cats scratch and play on it. This can leave your furniture and floors covered in fur if you're not careful |
