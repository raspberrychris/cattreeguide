### Product Description 

The AIWIKIDE Cat Tree offers a comfortable and spacious home for your cat. It has three levels for your cat to climb up and down, providing them with an excellent place to scratch, sleep and play. The hanging ball provides lots of fun and a hammock for relaxing. The hanging ball can also be replaced with a scratching post or toy. The top platform can let cats observe like a queen. It also lets cats watch the view outside the window or just take in the view from high up.

### Our Rating For This Product

The instructions could be a little more clear, but it was pretty easy to put together. It's not the most stable thing in the world and can wobble a bit when my 1-year-old runs at it, but it's doing the trick so far. I'll probably try to secure it to the ground/wall once I get the tools.
