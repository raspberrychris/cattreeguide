### Product Description 

TSCOMON's cat tree is designed to be stable and safe. The cat tower has 3 resting areas where cats can play, rest or perch. The cat condo provides enough space for 1-2 kittens, the sleeping basket provides comfortable sleeping space and the hammock is a secure place for cats to rest their weary heads. This versatile cat tree meets all the life needs of your indoor cats.

### Our Rating For This Product

If you are looking for a tall Cat Tree that your cats can use to look out of a window, this one will fit the bill. In fact, it's so tall, we ended up taking the top tier off - it was too high up! The height also makes it seem a bit wobbly, but it does come with a strap, which is easy enough to secure to the wall. Aesthetically, the direction diagrams are alright, but could be more clear with regards to all the parts and where they're supposed to go. If your cat is a big baby and sits on his backside, he may not fit well on the flat part if you leave the top tier on.

### Customers Say about this product

> This was fairly easy to put together, took about 30 minutes. My cat almost immediately jumped right on it, he loves it! His favorite part is the very top perch! For being over 5 feet tall it is surprisingly very sturdy. He will jump from my bed (which is about 3 feet away) all the way to the top perch and it will wobble a bit but has never fallen over!
