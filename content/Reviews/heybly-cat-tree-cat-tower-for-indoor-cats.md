### Product Description 

This cat tree provides a perfect place for your cats to play and relax. It has scratching posts, perches, and even a feeding bowl to keep the kittens happy and healthy. The wide scratching board is designed for cats to sharpen their claws. This cat tree is made of sturdy wood with a metal frame that's covered in sisal rope to prevent toppling during playtime. It's also designed with anti-toppling devices for added safety.
