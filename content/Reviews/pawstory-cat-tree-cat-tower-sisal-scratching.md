### Product Description 

Provide your cat with a great place to relax, play and scratch. The Pawstory Cat Tree, Cat Tower with Sisal Scratching Post is a multi-level cat condo that's perfect for both indoor cats and those who live outside as well. Made of high quality material, this sturdy cat tree features natural sisal rope that encourages scratching and is a healthier choice over plastic. It includes a wide base plate made of CARB certified P2 particleboard, which adds stability and supports heavier cats

### Our Rating For This Product

My cats are seriously in love with this cat tree. The hammock is too small for my two cats, but they regularly find their way onto the hammock. I ended up re-assembling it located on the central pole of the scratch pad, because otherwise the weight caused the structure to lean. It's much more sturdy in that configuration.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉  The cats are enjoying it: This is the most important thing, of course. If they weren't happy with it, there would be no point in having it.|👉  Not Well-Made: This cat tree appears to be flimsy and not very well-made. |
| 👉  It's sturdy: Even though I had to reassemble it, once I did it seems to be holding up well against the weight of the cats using it.|👉 Unattractive Design: This cat tree has an unattractive design that looks cheaply made|
| 👉  The hammock is a good size for them: It's not too big or too small for our cats, and they seem to really like using it as a place to lounge around and take naps.|👉 May be too small for some bigger cats|
