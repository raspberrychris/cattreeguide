### Product Description 

Nova Cat Tree is a multi-level cat tree that is perfect for small cats to take a rest, play around and just be as active as they want. With soft fluffy plush covering, your cat will love their new castle. Choose from three different heights to suit your needs.

### Our Rating For This Product

It is a good cat tree and I recommend it to everyone.
In general, It is sturdy and lasts a long time, especially with a heavy cat. The color is good. The durability is not great but good enough. There are a few places my cat can get through it. Screws are not needed for assembly and it takes around 2 hours for the average person to put together. Assembly is easy, but does take some time.

### Customers Say about this product

> First off, this house is much smaller than it looks. Several of the pictures have photoshopped cats that are smaller in scale than the house. My kittens were 8 weeks old when I bought this and they fit fine.
