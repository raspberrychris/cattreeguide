### Our Rating For This Product

I'm giving this tree five stars because each of my cats love it. It's a great size for my apartment, and best of all, it doesn't look tacky! My two more timid cats hide away in the house all the time, but they both went up and down the cat tree without fear. I think they figured out how fun it was to be on high furniture! I've had no problem with scratching the carpet either. The posts are solid and the design is attractive. It was easy enough to put together

### Customers Say about this product

> Fairly easy to put together once you can figure out how the bottom goes. There are three holes and they are only slightly different lengths apart. So getting the right posts in the right holes so the hideaway fits was tricky for me…could have been just me.
