### Our Rating For This Product

My cat loves this product. To give you some background I have a cat who follows me around like he'll implode if he's more than two feet away from my feet.  He sniffed around the base and then tried to climb and then he just settled in. I watched him for a while, and he was purring like crazy. He can't go a day without using his new tree.
