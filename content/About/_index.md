{{< /lead >}}

Hi my name is Chris and I've been into music gear for as long as I can remember.  I think my first experience of music tech gear was in the 1990s when I got a Yamaha keyboard and discovered Midi.  Since that time I have been obsessed in trying to find the next new things that we can use to make music.
