I started [Cat Tree Guide](https://cattreeguide.com) through my abosolute love of cats. Every cat should have somewhere where they can feel comfortable and relax, play and enjoy time inside the house.  Cat trees allow them to do this easily.

Hi welcome to [Cat Tree Guide](https://cattreeguide.com), my name is Percy and I am the proud owner of a beautiful long fur Siberian Cat called Pacha. I live in an apartment in NYC, U.S. I used to travel a lot but don't do so much any more.

I have used many Cat trees over the years and thought it would be a good idea to start a website that reviewed my favorite ones. 

Cat trees are a really important part of the lifestyle for house cats in particular and I strongly believe that every indoor cat owner should have a cat tree.

Percy
