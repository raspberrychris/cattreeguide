### Customers Say about this product

> I purchased this hammock a year ago and it's still going strong. My cats have never cared about any other bed I've ever bought but theyve taken to this one immediately. There's a 100% chance that there is at least one cat in this hammock if they're not in the other room with me.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Cat-Approved: Your kitty will love this scratcher, as it's covered in catnip or something similar.|👉 Chew proofing: It would be nice if this was made out of a material that cats couldn't easily chew through or scratch.|
| 👉 Easy Assembly: All parts are included and labeled, so you shouldn't have any trouble putting it together.|👉 Size: It's a little small and my cats have already outgrown it. I wish it was just a bit larger so they could enjoy it for longer.|
| 👉 Good Construction: This scratcher is well-made and should last for a long time.|👉 Sturdiness: Can tip over if Cat is playing with it vigorously.|

### Our Rating For This Product

It is a good cat tree and I recommend it to everyone.
In general, It is sturdy and lasts a long time, especially with a heavy cat. The color is good. The durability is not great but good enough. There are a few places my cat can get through it. Screws are not needed for assembly and it takes around 2 hours for the average person to put together. Assembly is easy, but does take some time.

### Customers Say about this product

> First off, this house is much smaller than it looks. Several of the pictures have photoshopped cats that are smaller in scale than the house. My kittens were 8 weeks old when I bought this and they fit fine.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The house is small and kittens can easily fit in it.|👉  Kittens grow quickly and may outgrow this house|
| 👉  It has two upper perches which are stable and give the cats a place to play and relax.|👉  The house is smaller than it looks in pictures |
| 👉  The box that the perches mount on is not very stable, but it does not break easily and does not injure the cats.|👉  Stability in the upper perches could be better|

### Product Description 

The AIWIKIDE Cat Tree offers a comfortable and spacious home for your cat. It has three levels for your cat to climb up and down, providing them with an excellent place to scratch, sleep and play. The hanging ball provides lots of fun and a hammock for relaxing. The hanging ball can also be replaced with a scratching post or toy. The top platform can let cats observe like a queen. It also lets cats watch the view outside the window or just take in the view from high up.

### Our Rating For This Product

The instructions could be a little more clear, but it was pretty easy to put together. It's not the most stable thing in the world and can wobble a bit when my 1-year-old runs at it, but it's doing the trick so far. I'll probably try to secure it to the ground/wall once I get the tools.

> The tree itself looks nice and seems to be very sturdy. The top bed is very cushy. My son put it together for me and it took him about 1/2 hour. He said it was not bad at all.

| 👉 It's so soft! The quality of the cover semms really great, and the platform at the very top is basically a pillow.|👉  It doesn't have many features: This cat tree doesn't have many features compared to others on the market, which might make it less appealing to some customers.|

### Our Rating For This Product

I'm giving this tree five stars because each of my cats love it. It's a great size for my apartment, and best of all, it doesn't look tacky! My two more timid cats hide away in the house all the time, but they both went up and down the cat tree without fear. I think they figured out how fun it was to be on high furniture! I've had no problem with scratching the carpet either. The posts are solid and the design is attractive. It was easy enough to put together

### Customers Say about this product

> Fairly easy to put together once you can figure out how the bottom goes. There are three holes and they are only slightly different lengths apart. So getting the right posts in the right holes so the hideaway fits was tricky for me…could have been just me.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Three cats can use it at the same time: This tree is big enough for three cats to use at the same time, which is great if you have multiple pets. |👉  Difficult to Assemble: One of the potential cons of this cat tree is that it may be difficult to assemble. There are three holes and they are only slightly different lengths apart, so getting the right posts in the right holes so the hideaway fits can be tricky|
| 👉  Hammock: The hammocks on this tree are a hit with my cats, and they love lounging in them.|👉  Not Suitable for All Cats: This cat tree is smaller, so it may not be suitable for all cats. Some larger cats may not be able to fit in the hide-a-way|
| 👉 Hide-a-way feature: My scaredy cat loves being able to hide away in this tree when she feels overwhelmed or nervous.|👉  May Not Be Durable: Another potential con is that this cat tree may not be as durable as other options on the market because it is smaller and made of lighter materials|

### Product Description 

This multi-level cat furniture will keep your indoor cat happy, healthy and entertained for hours. The BestPet 54in Cat Tree Tower for Indoor Cats provides a multitude of playful and comfortable places to rest or play. Each level offers multiple perches and a plushy condo where your kitty can curl up and sleep. There is also a sturdy sisal pole that they can scratch on if they desire. The BestPet Cat Tree is made from high-quality materials with skin-friendly faux fur all over.

### Our Rating For This Product

I really enjoy this cat tree tower. It's well made, and it's sturdy enough to handle my two playful cats. The fabric is really soft and high quality. I was worried the kittens would make a mess of it, but they haven't yet! The scratching post is thick and sisal in an excellent location, giving them an option to scratch when they want. I like the interaction the cat tree tower has with the rest of my living room décor. One thing I've noticed is that if you have long hair, watch out for getting it caught on the plushy material on the lounging/sleeping areas.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 It's well made and sturdy enough to handle two playful cats.|👉  Not all cats will use it: If you have more than one cat, there's no guarantee they'll both take to the cat tree tower.|
| 👉 The fabric is really soft and high quality. |👉  It can be unstable: The cat tree tower is top-heavy, so if your cats are climbing on it a lot or playing too roughly, it can tip over. This has happened to me twice already!
|
| 👉 The scratching post is thick and sisal in an excellent location, giving them an option to scratch when they want|👉  It sheds: Like all plushy fabrics, the fabric on the cat tree tower will shed over time as your cats scratch and play on it. This can leave your furniture and floors covered in fur if you're not careful |

It includes a wide base plate made of CARB certified P2 particleboard, which adds stability and supports heavier cats

### Our Rating For This Product

My cats are seriously in love with this cat tree. The hammock is too small for my two cats, but they regularly find their way onto the hammock. I ended up re-assembling it located on the central pole of the scratch pad, because otherwise the weight caused the structure to lean. It's much more sturdy in that configuration.

| 👉  It's sturdy: Even though I had to reassemble it, once I did it seems to be holding up well against the weight of the cats using it.|👉 Unattractive Design: This cat tree has an unattractive design that looks cheaply made|
| 👉  The hammock is a good size for them: It's not too big or too small for our cats, and they seem to really like using it as a place to lounge around and take naps.|👉 May be too small for some bigger cats|

### Product Description 

TSCOMON's cat tree is designed to be stable and safe. The cat tower has 3 resting areas where cats can play, rest or perch. The cat condo provides enough space for 1-2 kittens, the sleeping basket provides comfortable sleeping space and the hammock is a secure place for cats to rest their weary heads. This versatile cat tree meets all the life needs of your indoor cats.

### Our Rating For This Product

If you are looking for a tall Cat Tree that your cats can use to look out of a window, this one will fit the bill. In fact, it's so tall, we ended up taking the top tier off - it was too high up! The height also makes it seem a bit wobbly, but it does come with a strap, which is easy enough to secure to the wall. Aesthetically, the direction diagrams are alright, but could be more clear with regards to all the parts and where they're supposed to go. If your cat is a big baby and sits on his backside, he may not fit well on the flat part if you leave the top tier on.

### Customers Say about this product

> This was fairly easy to put together, took about 30 minutes. My cat almost immediately jumped right on it, he loves it! His favorite part is the very top perch! For being over 5 feet tall it is surprisingly very sturdy. He will jump from my bed (which is about 3 feet away) all the way to the top perch and it will wobble a bit but has never fallen over!

### Our Rating For This Product

My cat loves this product. To give you some background I have a cat who follows me around like he'll implode if he's more than two feet away from my feet.  He sniffed around the base and then tried to climb and then he just settled in. I watched him for a while, and he was purring like crazy. He can't go a day without using his new tree.

### Customers Say about this product

> My cat loves to bake his old bones in direct sunlight. This is his favorite spot right in front of the window. I set it up and waited til the right time of day (morning sun) to show him his new sunny spot and he loved it immediately. My other cat loves the scratcher posts below it. Definitely a good buy for them.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉  The cat likes it!|👉 Not durable: The construction of the cat tree is a little on the light side, which means it may not be able to withstand a lot of wear and tear.|
| 👉 The kitty uses it daily and likes taking naps on it.|👉 May be unstable: Because the construction is not very sturdy, there is a risk that the cat tree could topple over if it is knocked into or if your cat jumps onto it with too much force. |
| 👉 It is a good height for the cat to sit on and look out of the window.|👉 Scratch posts are unnecessary: The included scratch posts are unnecessary because most cats will probably not use them.|

### Product Description 

FEANDREA Cat Tower is made of high-quality, eco-friendly and pet-safe materials. The cat tower is not only a cat tree, but also a scratching post and a perch. It has two top perches that are filled to the brim with soft padding to provide comfort for your cats. The scratching board is also a ramp and it can be used by cats as a ladder to climb up and down easily. The cat area has plenty of room for larger cats.

### Our Rating For This Product

My cat loves this tree. Up top, there's a little hammock and even a hole for hiding. The bottom is covered in a soft carpet for lounging on. There are ample dangling toys, including one that hangs right in the middle of the tree. The top of the tree has a plush pad with a tunnel leading to the bottom. All in all, this is a good quality tree that my cat seems to really enjoy - and at this price, it's worth it.

### Customers Say about this product

> This is a good-looking Cat Tower or, as I prefer, Cat Condo. But my two cats are too big for it. My brother and sister cats weigh 15lbs and 13lbs respectively. The two platforms do not accommodate them. They won't even try getting on-board. It's going to make a nice gift for my neighbor whose cats are smaller.

### Our Rating For This Product

It is a very sturdy, good looking tower and I would highly recommend it. Assembly took 10 minutes and the instructions were easy to follow.

I have seen some "cheapo" towers in other people's homes that are poorly made and look tatty, so I was surprised at how well the instructions were. I built up quite a bit of trust with amazon basics brand over the years, either with pet things or cables, kitchen things. The one thing that is consistent is there are few bells and whistles, but what you get is reliably and robustly made. This tower takes up a lot of room, but it was worth the purchase.

### Product Description 

A cat tree for larger cats, this cat tower features a widened perch and is filled to the brim with edges to ensure your cats can stretch out comfortably. With a scratching board and a ladder in one, this two-in-one scratcher helps your cats scratch their itch or get up if they're elderly or have mobility issues. Made with 2 doors, this cat cave lets you easily let your cat in and out of the fluffy cave or go to the basket.

### Our Rating For This Product

This cat tower is the best purchase I've made for my cat. I wanted him to be able to easily get to a window sill we have and he could get to the second level, but then he couldn't get to the top because the oversized bed hung too far over. So, I took the top off and put that piece on the floor. He loves sleeping in it (on the floor) and can still get to the window sill when he wants to using the 2 levels left.

### Our Rating For This Product

The TINWEI cat tree is a great size for our smaller cat, and it has had a lot of enjoyment. Our cat has enjoyed climbing, lounging, and playing with the three accessories. We haven't had any issues with it thus far. It took about 30 minutes to assemble, but it is basically like building any other piece of boxed furniture. This size is perfect for our 13 week old kitten, and it was worth the effort and the price.

### Customers Say about this product

> Relatively simple to assemble. The base was broken in the corner when it arrived unfortunately. It was right on the screw area so it broke even more when I was assembling. Luckily it seems ok for now and my cat is only 4 pounds so I'm hoping it will be fine. For the price, it's a nice cat tree.

My cat loved it. I love the tree, and it's tall so my cat can sit at the top or in nooks and crannies while I work.
I got a little worried when I was putting the ladder on.
Pros - Tall, easy to assemble, comes with its own wrench
Cons - Expensive for its size, screws were hard to put in

The Yaheetech cat tree is a perfect way to give your pets a space that is all their own.

The tower is made from carefully-selected materials, so it's both safe for your pets and for you.

### Our Rating For This Product

Assembly was easy, but I must warn you, there are a lot of pieces. I recommend using a socket wrench instead of an allen key, because assembly time is quite long with the allen key (think more than two hours). The price was a bit steep for me but I'm so happy I invested in a good product.

### Customers Say about this product

> Our 11 mo old kittens love every square inch of this. They even use the hammock.  One perches on the top and the other perches on the second tower. I do notice that the tower posts will wobble so I tend to turn them tighter for stability.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The parts were standard quality and didn't have any issues.|👉 The risk of the plastic breaking if the bolts are tightened too hard.
 |
| 👉 Just gotta make sure not to tighten the bolts too hard so that the plastic doesn't break. |👉 The metal ring that attaches the strap to the wall ripped immediately.|

### Product Description 

FEANDREA has a solution for your cat's boredom, stress, and loneliness. Your cat will love the soft plush, the many perches (including a hammock!), and the comfortable cushion in this large cat tower. With 3 removable pompoms and a spacious cave, there's plenty of room for cats to play and have fun.

### Our Rating For This Product

It is easy to set up and it is nice and tall for a tower. It also has a button strap so you can secure the tower to the wall for stability, which is great because my cats are very playful and I'm always worried they are going to knock it over. The material is soft and cool to the touch. There are two levels with different sections of size, and the second level has a little house for your cat to sleep in or play in. Support pieces are at the bottom which helps keep the base from wobbling.

> Three indoor kitties, one of whom is enthusiastically adamant about his personal bubble, took to this cat tree so beautifully.. it has room for all of them to occupy it simultaneously & apparently is very comfortable. They love the height and play or lay on it almost constantly

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The platforms are padded and have a decent bumper on the sides. |👉 Cats ruin the tree: The girls love their new tree, but it doesn't last long because the cats quickly ruin it. |
| 👉 The condo got an adjustment, because one of our girls lives to look out the window.|👉 The platforms are too small: The platforms on the new tree are too small for the cats, and they will need to be replaced soon.|
| 👉 The platforms themselves are too small if I'm being honest, but the cats are a bit smaller than other kitties so ut will work for awhile |👉 The condo got an adjustment: One of our cats lives to look out the window, so we had to adjust the condo accordingly.|

### Our Rating For This Product

I was impressed by the Yaheetech Cat Tree Tower Kitten Condo Scratching Post with Hammock Tunnel. I definitely noticed a difference in my kitten's activity level and energy levels just from putting this in their living space. I was worried about the stability because it is a tall tower, but then I found out that there is an anchor strap to secure it to the wall so that it won't topple over.

### Customers Say about this product

> The only complaint I have about this is that one of the rings on the ladder part came off within a week of getting it, leaving exposed staples that the kitties could get scratched on. Easy enough fix to glue it back on, but I wish it was more durable.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The cat condo is made of sturdy materials and is able to withstand rough play. |👉 The circle makes the cat get stuck: One of the potential cons of this product is that the circle in it can cause the cat to get stuck. This can happen if the cat is not careful or if it is not very agile.|
| 👉 The cat condo has multiple levels and features, providing your cat with plenty of space to explore and play.|👉 The hammock only fits a kitten: Another potential con of this product is that the hammock included with it only fits a kitten, so it would not be suitable for larger cats. |
| 👉 The cat condo is carpeted, providing a soft surface for your cat to lounge on. |👉 The carpet may not hold up over time: Another potential issue with this product is that the carpeting on it may not hold up over time, potentially creating an issue for those who have pets who like to scratch or claw at things.|

### Our Rating For This Product

If you have a large house and want to give your cats a space to climb, this is the perfect cat tree for them. We had a 67" cat tree and two cats. The youngest loved it, but our eldest never used it. Then my husband found out he has diabetes and his back legs were starting to give out. Our old cat tree just wasn't suitable anymore. We wanted to upgrade to something that would help with his climbing and the boys love this cat tree! There are different heights so the youngest can use all the tallest towers, and the eldest loves everything else. We've even seen him climb to the upper house, with only one thing - it's been hard to find him because he's not as vocal anymore.

### Product Description 

The PETEPELA Cat Tower is a great way to provide your cat with climbing and lounging areas. The entire cat tree consists of 5 levels of platforms, each with a height difference of 17.3 inches per level. The tension rod on the top can be adjusted to a preferred height from high to low (95-109 Inches) and the posts are thicker than other posts on the market, making this tree both sturdy and durable.

### Our Rating For This Product

The pet tree is a good selection for indoor cats that need exercise. I like the height adjustment so it doesn't hog too much bedroom space and goes to about an inch from the ceiling. I had some issues with assembly. The product page says the height is adjustable between 89.8-107.9 inches, but when assembled the tower was less than an inch from the ceiling. The compression topper is also just under an inch on its own, so there wasn't much room to install the extension tubes. All in all, though, it's a good deal and worth the price if you're looking for a cat tower.

### Our Rating For This Product

This is a pretty tall cat tree and my cats love it. It can be wobbly and I wouldn't recommend it for a small apartment or if the cats are aggressive, but otherwise the cats really seem to like it. My two boys have been using it for a month now and it's still intact.

### Our Rating For This Product

I would say I had an overall positive experience with the tree. It took me about an hour to assemble and it was pretty easy. I like how stable it is and as expected, my cat loves it. The only thing that I didn't enjoy about the tree was that the posts weren't quite heavy enough so the whole thing is a bit wobbly when my cat is on top. Once my cat gets used to this, it won't be a problem. Overall, I'm happy with the product.

I bought this because my cats were using the tops of their cat tree as scratching posts and I liked the idea of them having their own scratch post.

Vesper Cat Furniture is perfect if you're on the lookout for a cat tower that will look nice with your home's decor and isn't ugly. It's easy to clean, and the soft parts are detachable and can be cleaned or replaced.

The size of this cat house is perfect for my two large cats. It's well padded, the cubbies are big enough, and it looks good too!

### Customers Say about this product

> The cat tree is very sturdy and the fabric is very soft as well. It was easy to assemble and it came with the tools needed. They even added in extras just in case you needed them. I was having a hard time finding one big enough for my cat but this fits her pretty good. I highly recommend this cat tree for your furry friends! Mine loves it!

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The cats really like the hideaway box. |👉 The cats really like the hideaway box, but it's not very big and doesn't provide much space for them to move around in or play with toys.|
| 👉 It was fairly easy to assemble and the pieces all seam sturdy.|👉 It was fairly easy to assemble, but some of the pieces are a bit flimsy and seem like they could break easily if cats scratched at them too much.|
| 👉 The old one is in the room yet, so there is no need to worry about the cats getting used to a new piece of furniture right away. |👉 The round half- pouch that hangs to the side is a good idea, but the weight of my cat14lbs. caused it to sink to the side that isn’t attached to the pole.|

The cheese wheel on the middle platform has 3 balls inside with an enticing flavor that cats just can't resist!

### Our Rating For This Product

### Customers Say about this product

> My fur-baby loves it! I have it in the kitchen so when I’m in there she has something to do other than lie under my feet. She’s still a kitten and weighs 5lbs. She plays with all levels (and already has ripped one of the mice off it’s string), and sleeps on it.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The activity tower kept my kitten entertained and busy throughout the night.|👉 Not sturdy enough: The activity tower is not sturdy enough, and the towers can start falling down or tearing out of the foundation.|
| 👉 I started putting cat treats in with the jingle balls, which turned the activity tower into their favorite toy.|👉 Costs money: The activity tower costs money to purchase, and it may need to be replaced frequently|
| 👉 The towers are easy to assemble and take apart.|👉 Could be more durable.|

### Product Description 

The Hey-brother Multi-level Cat Tree Condo for Large Cats is a space-saving, versatile and multifunctional cat tree that offers scratching, climbing, sleeping and exercising options.

It also has a roomy condo on the bottom floor and two top large platforms with an internal extra-thick mat. It includes interactive jingly balls and sisal twine to play with as well

### Our Rating For This Product

It’s a great choice if you need to separate two cats that hate each other. The size is perfect, it’s not too wide or tall, so it can be placed in any room. My cats are 15-17 lbs and they fit with room to spare. I would recommend getting some adhesive hooks to fix this to the wall, since it is big and doesn't come with screws. But either way, my cats are happy which means I'm happy.

### Product Description 

The Yaheetech Cat Tree Tower Condo is designed for one or two large kittens. The max weight capacity of this cat tower is 66lb. This cat tree is constructed with particle boards to ensure stability. Anti-toppling fittings are included for double security. This cat activity tree has a large cushioned platform bed with raised edging and a soft comfy basket at the bottom.

### Our Rating For This Product

This is one of the best cat trees I've ever seen. It is a great height for both perching and scratching. I am cautious about bolting it in, but it's held up without any problems. I would have liked the enclosed house to be more square, with no hammock, and a ball toy at the bottom. My cats love this tower and it is pretty stable as long as you follow the instructions to put it together. I would recommend this for any cat-owning family. One tower should do the trick.

### Customers Say about this product

> I love all the many activities and extras that most trees don't have. I didn't like that the screw in the house part sticks up and can hurt the kitty. I'm going to cut off the extra or put 2 washers on it for safety.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Cats can lay on top bed or on the bottom and middle flat parts|👉 The hanging ball toy did not hold up.|
| 👉 The inside of the ball is just more of the soft fabric|👉 The rope came unbraided within the same time frame and is fraying rapidly. |

### Our Rating For This Product

I ordered this cat tree in black. It is not black. I'm not sure why the box was marked black but the color is definitely medium grey. The piece is sturdy and of good quality, but I am disappointed because I wanted a black cat tree. I'm keeping it because it's just too much of a hassle to go through the process of returning it, but I would recommend if you're looking for a medium-grey cat tree.

### Our Rating For This Product

 It was really easy to assemble, even if the directions had multiple technical errors which made me think the directions were written based on autocad plans instead of actual assembly. For example, the screws didn't trim the full 360 degrees and some were inserted upside down so it wasn't possible to turn them in the direction the instructions suggested. These simple mistakes aside, installation was easy enough to figure out and I appreciated that.

### Our Rating For This Product

The quality is pretty good, but the hammock is a little loose and the hooks come undone easily (keep an eye out for wet patches near the hammock). I saw another review where the cat knocked the whole hammock over and the hooks came off too.  Overall, it's a great value for your money so long as you're careful with it.

### Product Description 

Get your cat excited for a new adventure with this small, but mighty cat tree. Living in a small space doesn’t mean you have to compromise your love for your cat. This cat tree is only 16.1” x 18.1” but offers endless joy from climbing, scratching and relaxing. The top perch is equipped with a removable cover for easy cleaning, which can be easily removed and washed when it comes time to clean up food stains or accidents. Worried that

### Our Rating For This Product

I love this cat tree, but I do wish I had purchased the next size up. I have two cats, both of which are the same weight, and so it is hard to find a good balance between stability and mobility. It is also a little small for my two cats to cozy in comfortably. It’s just not quite big enough for them. The circular bed is too small for them and would only fit a kitten.

### Our Rating For This Product

Very nice product.. only issue I had was the nuts and bolts fell out of the packaging and was all over in the box while shipping... they were all still there but a couple pieces(small funky screws) fell into the columns and I spent about an hour trying to shake them out.. also, the instruction diagram isn't printed large enough and I missed a crucial very first step that I had to come back to when I realized I had a set of spare parts...LOL.. All in all, it just took me about an hour to get it put all together and I really like the quality and esthetic of it.

> I have 4 cats and they all use this tree. My two smaller cats like the hammock best and my two large cats (12 -17lbs) love the top shelf. I love the way it looks and it is so much easier to clean than my previous carpeted tree.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Attractive design |👉 The plastic container for the screws, etc. did come apart so they all fell to the bottom of the box when pulling everything out.|
| 👉 Easy to assemble|👉 It was still really easy to see what's what because the instructions are fairly thorough.|
| 👉 Cats love it |👉 My only concern are the 4 straps that hold the Tunnel Swing.|

### Our Rating For This Product

We bought this for a playpen for young kittens that are not yet ready to be playing outside. The price and quality were as expected. It's a little too flimsy for the design, so we assembled two smaller wood structures rather than one larger one. It's perfect for our kittens, and our momma cat even uses it sometimes.

### Customers Say about this product

> The kitten uses this almost every day and loves it. She did get her paw caught on one of dangling strings and we had to cut it off to free her. It was also a bit difficult to put together, maybe one or two steps tougher than IKEA furniture.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Inexpensive|👉 Not Durable: It is made of cheap materials and is not durable.|
| 👉 Easily assembled|👉 Too Flimsy: If you try to make one structure as designed, it will be too flimsy and might collapse under the weight of the kittens or mom.|
| 👉 Flexible|👉 Limited Usefulness: It can only be used for very young kittens to put into a playpen. Once they outgrow it, it will no longer be useful for them.|

### Our Rating For This Product

The dimensions on the website make it seem smaller than it really is which is a plus. It's large enough that we haven't had any tippling issues yet and small enough that it doesn't feel overwhelming. It's also sturdy enough that you can play with a cat on it without it breaking. It was easy to assemble and all the holes were cut properly for those who are assembling themselves. It's definitely worth the money.

### Customers Say about this product

> This tree is easy to assemble. (Once you fine the instructions! Lol) the photo makes it seem larger than it is. My boys are on the larger side of the cat size. (Not fat. Just sturdy 14lb and 15lb) and they play rough just like brothers do. Fingers crossed that this one lasts longer then 6months.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Cats love it: Both of the cats in the house have taken to this new piece of furniture and claim different parts as their own.|👉 It takes up a lot of space: This cat tree is huge! It's taller than me and quite wide, so it takes up a lot of space in my home.|
| 👉 It's quite sturdy: Despite being tall and wide, this piece of furniture is surprisingly sturdy and well-built.|👉 My cats never use the bottom area: The bottom of the cat tree has a reclining area, but my cats have never used it. I think it's because they like the higher perches better.|
| 👉 It offers great views: The top perch provides a perfect spot for one of the cats to nap while also getting a good view out the window.|👉 It's not very stylish: This cat tree is functional, but it's not very stylish. If you're looking for something to match your home décor, this might not be the right choice for you|
